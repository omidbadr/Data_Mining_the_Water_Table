# Data_Mining_the_Water_Table
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, it can be predicted which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. 
This is a competition by DrivenData. 
Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which water points will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
